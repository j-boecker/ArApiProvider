# ArApiProvider
REST API and .NET core website to manage data for room plans.
 
This is a website to provide API Endpoints that should be consumed in Unity to fetch data of objects for a scene. In the future this should be used for to upload objects that can be displayed with AR. 

The corresponding client programmed in Unity can be found here: 
https://github.com/j-boecker/UnityRoomPlanClient

The website is also hosted with azure here:

Editing a roomplan was made with some simple JS using KonvaJs. To get full control over the API go the https://arwebapiproviderdemo.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html
